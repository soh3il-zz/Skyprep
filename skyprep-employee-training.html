              <h1>Employee Training</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>Businesses and Organizations</h2>
            <p>SkyPrep online training software makes employee training and testing simple. Our web based training software allows you to to train your employees through engaging courses and ensure training material has been understood through tests. Your employees will have a training tool that‘s accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Online training has never been this easy. Learn how our online training software can work for you.</p>

            <h2>Create engaging courses and test employees</h2>
            <p>Train your employees with all your existing content. Easily add training material including, documents, videos and images. Watch your employees learn the training material, and test them on it</p>

            <h2>Communicate and view detailed reports</h2>
            <p>Our online software sends automated email reminders to your employees if new training content is available. Create an online environment where employees can discuss and ask questions. Real-time detailed reports reveal all the information you need.</p>

            <h2>Recognize employee achievements</h2>

              <h1>Training Your Staff</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>Technical Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Employee competence in the workplace is an obvious essential. After all, if your lead programmer doesn’t know how to use the latest programming language, your business is already behind the industry curb. But imparting technical knowledge in a classroom atmosphere can be tedious, inconvenient and expensive. Online training gives you the means to teach your employees all the skills they need to be successful, all using the convenience of the internet.

It’s also much more affordable and engaging for your learners. Often times, employees aren’t interested in attending training seminars to develop new skills or learn about corporate policies, so constantly setting up these programs can be ineffective whilst still being costly and time consuming. Creating engaging learning content with videos and powerpoint presentations allows employees to learn from the comfort of their computer, making it far less of a chore to do the work. And it’ll be at a fraction of the cost.</p>

            <h2>Job Procedures</h2>
            <p>When a new employee is hired, or an existing employee’s role is altered to replace a previous employee, it can take some time for the new guy to learn the intricacies of their job.

As such, many times there is nobody to take the newly positioned employee under their wing to learn the ins and outs of the job. You as an employer can ease fresh employees into new jobs by creating learning material that give your new workers an outline of what positions entail. Certainly you can expect them to periodically ask questions in person, but having documents online that they can reference at any time to help them understand the responsibilities of their job is useful, without making them feel uninformed.</p>

              <h1>Compliance Training</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Compliance training is essential for organizations as it minimizes the risks of running a business. When your employees demonstrate that they understand the laws, regulations and company policies, you will maximize your company’s potential and avoid ruining your business’ reputation.

Online training is an effective and cost effective tool to train your employees.</p>

          <h2>Why Compliance Training</h2>
          <h4>It’s the Law</h4>
          <p>In many states or provinces, there are regulations that must be followed by organizations.  With a proper training curriculum, you can detect or avoid violations by employees that can lead to legal liability.</p>

          <h4>Employee Improvement</h4>
          <p>By understanding laws and company policies, employees will work in a more hospitable and respectful work place, leaving you with less concerns.</p>

          <h4>Business Improvement</h4>
          <p>Business productivity increases, while detecting and preventing misconduct sets the groundwork for defense in the event an employee wrongdoing does occur.</p>

          <h2>Why SkyPrep as a solution</h2>

          <h4>Fast and Reliable</h4>
          <p>SkyPrep’s web-based training platform provides a simple and reliable delivery tool to ensure that all your employees are up to date with their training. Rather then setting up in-class training sessions, and disrupting business, employees can access their training material on their schedule, from anywhere in the world.</p>

          <h4>Cost Effective</h4>
          <p>Rather then budgeting for in-class sessions and travel expenses, SkyPrep provides a much more cost-effective tool to train employees. Also, as each employee learns at their own pace, their online training provides them a more effective tool to review and understand material. In addition, as new information or new policies become available, you can update your content to ensure your online training software is always up to date.</p>

          <h4>Track Performance</h4>
          <p>SkyPrep allows you to track your employees’ training progression. You can see how each employee is doing by following their course progress and reviewing their test scores. You can also review and print these results in reports. You’ll know which employees understand the material and which ones need more training, making sure you’re always on top of your company staff.</p>
